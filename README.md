# Pedestrian-Detection
 pedestrian detection involves developing a machine learning model that can effectively detect and recognize pedestrians in street images . This task presents unique challenges such as accounting for scale, perspective, occlusion, and potentially motion. The model should be able to operate reliably in a variety of settings and lighting conditions.
